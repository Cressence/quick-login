# Quick Payment Application with React-Native

We will be building a mobile application which enables you to allow payment after scanning a QR code. This tutorial will showcase the concept of data management in React-Native for beginners.

We will be using react-Native for the following reasons:
* Since it is based on JavaScript, we do not need to learn a whole new language in order to use it
* It is easy to incoporate third-party libraries and connect to APIs

## The App
Before we dive into building the app, let us go through a the flow of the application. 

Add user flow here

* First we have a screen which directs the user to the QR Code reader
* After the user scans the code, we make a call to the local mobile money service whoch will ask us to confirm payment.
* When transaction is complete, we then show a success or error message

For example, if I was using a QR CODE reader application to get data from a QR Code, I would
 * Open the QR Code reader
 * Scan the document
 * The app will follow the instructions gotten from the code. In this example open a particular link.

 **NB:**  This tutorial will not cover how to generate QR Codes.
